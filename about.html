    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
    <p>
      The journey of crafting our pizzas begins long before the oven is fired up. It starts with the hands of passionate bakers who rise early each day to knead dough with care, letting it rest and rise just right. Every ingredient is chosen not just for flavor, but for the feeling it brings — ripe tomatoes, hand-picked herbs, and cheeses that melt to perfection. As the pizzas bake, the aroma fills the air, carrying with it the love and dedication poured into every step. More than just food, each slice is a moment of comfort — made to warm the soul and bring joy to our customers with every bite.
